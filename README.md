This repository is for the Module 2 Challenge 

Enclosed in this repo is homework for Module 2 (menu.py) which is an ordering 
application to order items from four categories (snacks, meals, drinks, and 
desserts).  

I pulled from a lot of the material covered in module 2 during the week, to
complete this challenge.  One area in particular however, that which calls for
the printing of the items ordered in a particular format, I referenced and used
a lot of what was already within the menu.py.  I added an area beyond what the 
assignment called for by printing an additional column that contained the item 
line cost (result of multiplying the Q x P).  I'm hoping this will be considered
extra credit as opposed to not following the assignment explicitly :-). 

A real challenge for me in this assignment, where I spent more time than
anticipated, was the use of the built-in function - SUM(). I originally thought this 
would be a piece of cake, but consistenly ran into problems.  I stepped away and 
slept on it.  Error messages I would always get, stated that the item to be
summed was not iterable.  My problem was my relying on other programming
language concepts in this area.  Once I really focus on the error message that 
my field to be summed was not iterable, I stored the result into a list, 
and then summed the list wa-la.
